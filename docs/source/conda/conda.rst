Conda and Anaconda
==================

Conda is a Python package manager, virtual environment manager, and more.

Conda is a package manager, similar to pip. It helps you take care of your different packages by handling installing, updating 
and removing them. The advantage over pip is that it automatically creates isolated environments for different projects, and it 
can install data science libraries that are not written in Python (e.g., “R”, C, etc.). It is the most popular package manager 
for data science.

Anaconda is a “batteries included” distribution of Python that includes over 150 data science packages. It uses Conda as its 
package manager.
